# Planning Documents

This directory contains internal planning documents for FinTrack development.

## Contents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) | Implementation timeline and phase planning |

## Purpose

Planning documents are kept separate from user-facing documentation to:
- Keep the root directory clean
- Separate internal planning from user guides
- Maintain focus on implementation details

## Adding New Planning Documents

When adding planning documents, consider:
- Sprint backlogs
- Feature specifications
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Test plans
